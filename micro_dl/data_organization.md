# Data Organization for Virtual Staining

> This advisory only applies to data management on Biohub's compute infrastructure.
> It is not normative for external users.

Here we document the conventions for storing data, metadata, configs,
and models during the development of the virtual staining pipeline.

## Data flow in the pipeline

TODO: Following diagram captures the planned flow of data and metadata through the new version of the pipeline.

### Preprocessing

Parameters are provided via the CLI, and stored in the attributes of
the OME-Zarr datasets using [iohub](https://github.com/czbiohub/iohub).
The metadata is in json format that is practical to edit by hand.

### Training

We use the PyTorch Lightning framework for training,
which provides [good defaults](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/1.6.5/common/lightning_cli.html)
for CLI and training configs,
and organized TensorBoard [logs](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/extensions/logging.html).

### Inference

The inference module does not depend on lightning, but just on PyTorch.
Parameters are provided with CLI and stored with the OME-Zarr datasets,
similar to preprocessing.

> This can be further incorporated into the lightning pipeline

### Evaluation

Evaluating the models requires human proof-reading of ground truth.
Currently computing the evaluation metrics does not depend on PyTorch.

> This can be further incorporated into the lightning pipeline

### Deployment

For run-time deployment, we export the model to the ONNX format.

## Data hierarchy

Data generated by the pipeline is stored on the file system following this schema:

```yaml
# project root directory
virtual_staining:
    # registerd, deconvolved, preprocessed OME-Zarr stores
    datasets:
        train:
            yyyymmdd_dataname0.zarr
            yyyymmdd_dataname1.zarr
            ...
        test:
            yyyymmdd_dataname0.zarr
            yyyymmdd_dataname1.zarr
            ...
        # FOVs with human-proof-read ground truth segmentation masks
        ground_truth:
            yyyymmdd_dataname0_gt:
